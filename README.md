### Proposal
#### Domain Background

In this Project I will be working the Retinal Optical Coherence Tomography and how it is used to detect different retinal diseases.
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging test. OCT uses light waves to take cross-section pictures of your retina.
With OCT, your ophthalmologist can see each of the retina’s distinctive layers.  This allows your ophthalmologist to map and measure their thickness. These measurements help with diagnosis. They also provide treatment guidance for glaucoma and diseases of the retina. These retinal diseases include age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic eye disease.
Retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging technique used to capture high-resolution cross sections of the retinas of living patients. Approximately 30 million OCT scans are performed each year, and the analysis and interpretation of these images takes up a significant amount of time (Swanson and Fujimoto, 2017).
